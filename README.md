# Python Maze Solver

This project provides a Python implementation for solving mazes using graph search algorithms.

## Features

- Reads maze structure from text files
- Implements Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Displays the found path and execution time
- Handles errors such as file not found or no solution

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Collections (deque)

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/danielangelo1/maze-path-finder
   ```

2. Run the program:

```bash
 python main.py
```

3.Enter the maze file path:

```bash
maze/maze3.txt
```
